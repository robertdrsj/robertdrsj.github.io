### Goals and Milestones
Over the next 5-8 years, there are two specific goals I intend to accomplish: (1) Obtain a graduate degree in STEM and (2) become fluent in Spanish in a professional capacity. I believe that expanding my knowledge into fields outside of XR and game development and into cloud, data, and AI technologies will aid my growth as a Software Engineer. To that end, a graduate degree and supplemental certifications will help get me there.

As for Spanish, it has been a great experience thus far to immerse myself in other cultures (most recently in LATAM), and learning a new language has provided me with a new avenue towards understanding rural and indigenous communities, as well as becoming a more effective volunteer and global citizen. And as someone who spends most of their professional time in front of a computer screen, volunteering allows me to be more physically and socially active whilst providing balance between high- and low-tech lifestyles.
