## Goals and Milestones
Over the next 8 years, there are three specific goals I intend to accomplish: (1) Publish 3-5 products on the Unity Asset Store, (2) Obtain a graduate degree in STEM and (3) become fluent in Spanish in a professional capacity. Over the _last_ 8 years, I've learned much about common pain points in XR and app production, and I would like to share some of the solutions I've created with other creators and organizations. I also believe that expanding my knowledge into fields outside of XR will aid my growth as a Software Engineer. To that end, a graduate degree and supplemental certifications will help get me there.

As for Spanish, it has been a great experience thus far to immerse myself in other cultures (most recently in LATAM), and learning a new language has provided me with a new avenue towards understanding rural and indigenous communities, as well as becoming a more effective volunteer and global citizen. And as someone who spends most of their professional time in front of a computer screen, volunteering allows me to be more physically and socially active whilst providing balance between high- and low-tech lifestyles.

In summary, I intend to achieve the following goals by 2032:
1. Publish 3 asset packs on the Unity Asset Store
2. Graduate Certificate, Computer Programming @ North Carolina State University
3. DELE B1 Spanish: Intermediate
4. M.S., Computer Science (Data Science Track) @ North Carolina State University
5. Eng.D., Data Science @ Eindhoven University of Technology
